        Welcome to Bright Monsters..! Hi my name is Beenish, I’m a software
        enginner and a mum of 3 <br />
        little monsters
      </p>
      <p>
        We all understand how important it is to balance life and lifestyle,
        especially when we are around
        <br /> kids (very important part of our life) And in this crazy busy
        world and so many things going on in
        <br /> our lives it’s hard to keep track on every thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        As being a mum I know, it is very hard to juggle between work, bills
        house chores and kids. So to <br /> make my life easy I design this
        website. Which work as kids personal assistant. Where parents or
        <br />
        teachers can login and assign each kid their homework and chores.
